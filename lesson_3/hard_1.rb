# Question 1
# What do you expect to happen when the greeting variable is referenced in the last line of the code below?
if false
  greeting = "hello world"
end

greeting

# my_answer =>
# the variable will not have a value because it has not been assigned to anything. 

# correct_answer =>
# greeting is nil here, and no "undefined method or local variable" exception is thrown. Typically, when you reference an uninitialized variable, Ruby will raise an exception, stating that it’s undefined. However, when you initialize a local variable within an if block, even if that if block doesn’t get executed, the local variable is initialized to nil.

# Question 2
# What is the result of the last line in the code below?
greetings = { a: 'hi' }
informal_greeting = greetings[:a]
informal_greeting << ' there'

puts informal_greeting  #  => "hi there"
puts greetings

# my_answer =>
# { a: 'hi'}

# correct_answer =>
# The output is {:a=>"hi there"}. The reason is because informal_greeting is a reference to the original object. The line informal_greeting << ' there' was using the String#<< method, which modifies the object that called it. This means that the original object was changed, thereby impacting the value in greetings. If instead of modifying the original object, we wanted to only modify informal_greeting but not greetings, there are a couple of options:

# we could initialize informal_greeting with a reference to a new object containing the same value by informal_greeting = greetings[:a].clone.
# we can use string concatenation, informal_greeting = informal_greeting + ' there', which returns a new String object instead of modifying the original object.

# Question 3
# What will be printed by each of these code groups?
# A)
def mess_with_vars(one, two, three)
  one = two
  two = three
  three = one

one = "one"
two = "two"

# Question 4
# Ben was tasked to write a simple ruby method to determine if an input string is an IP address representing dot-separated numbers. e.g. "10.4.5.11". He is not familiar with regular expressions. Alyssa supplied Ben with a method called is_an_ip_number? that determines if a string is a numeric string between 0 and 255 as required for IP numbers and asked Ben to use it.
def dot_separated_ip_address?(input_string)
  dot_separated_words = input_string.split(".")
  while dot_separated_words.size > 0 do
    word = dot_separated_words.pop
    break unless is_an_ip_number?(word)
  end
  return true
end

# Alyssa reviewed Ben's code and says "It's a good start, but you missed a few things. You're not returning a false condition, and you're not handling the case that there are more or fewer than 4 components to the IP address (e.g. "4.5.5" or "1.2.3.4.5" should be invalid)."
# Help Ben fix his code.

# my_answer =>
def dot_separated_ip_address?(input_string)
  dot_separated_words = input_string.split(".")
  while dot_separated_words.size == 4 do
    word = dot_separated_words.pop
    if is_an_ip_number?(word)
      break
    else
      puts "Error"
  end
end

# correct_answer =>
# The other error in Ben's code is that instead of returning false upon encountering a non-numeric component, he used break to break out of the while loop. Once he breaks, control falls through to the return true statement. He can fix this by performing return false instead of break.
def dot_separated_ip_address?(input_string)
  dot_separated_words = input_string.split(".")
  return false unless dot_separated_words.size == 4

  while dot_separated_words.size > 0 do
    word = dot_separated_words.pop
    return false unless is_an_ip_number?(word)
  end

  true
